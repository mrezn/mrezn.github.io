My name is Mohammadreza Najafi. I am a Master's student at the Department of Computer Engineering, Chosun University, Gwangju, South Korea. My research interests include Computer Vision, AI Accelerators, Embedded Systems, Low power and Realtime Computer Vision,Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems and Robotics and Autonomous systems.

## Research Exprience 
**Chosun university and NH company(LINC project)**[August 2022 to January  2023]
*Deploy low power crowd detection and crowd alert system on CCTVs(edge device)*


**Chosun university**[March 2022 until now]
*Research on low-power computer vision algorithms and deploy AI Accelerators for SVM and CNN in field of object detection and classification*
*Research on Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System in computer vision application*


**American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics(AIAA)**[September 2018 to May 2019]
*In the \textbf{AIAA} Aircraft Design Competition as the design of vertical electric aircraft with the ability to fly within the city,I was the designer of a \textbf{Autonomy system} and aircraft control system.*
*The proposal of our team won the first place in this competition.*

**Sharif University of Technology**[August 2019 to Present]
*Research on using ANN as tool for solving  Financial Dynamic Systems PDEs*
*Bachelor Thesis:*
Using Deep reinforcement learning to grab an object in 3D from one point to another point}.Practical implementation of this network on the robotic arm in the control laboratory.
*Design automate lifeguard quad-copter which can detect drowning by its embed camera.*

**Institute For Research In Fundamental Sciences (IPM)**[May 2019 to present]
*Using deep neural network and image processing to remove HTC Vive controller.*
*I trained a deep neural network that could recognize the texture of the hand in the input image,then connected the HTC Vive headset camera to this network. This allowed me to remove the controllers and execute all the controller commands without using the controller.*
